# Funds Calculator

This project is an exercise I built using the Svelte compiler. 
It's a variant of a simple to do app - a place to add, edit, and total up some funds being entered.

This project lives [here](https://bobby-valenzuela.github.io/FundsCalculator/).

To bundle up this project:

```bash
npm run build
```

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*
