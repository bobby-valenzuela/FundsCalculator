# Lost Satohis App

This project is an exercise I built using the Svelte compiler. 
Basically you can enter some items that you find you may be wasting money on. Then you can enter an approximate weekly spend amount for each of these items.

You can then track the amount over a given time and see how much it totals to if you would have saved all or a certain percentage of that money. Next you can see how much that would have been worth if that had been invested into some cryptocurrencies.

This project lives [here](https://github.com/sveltejs/template).

To bundle up this project:

```bash
npm run build
```

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*
